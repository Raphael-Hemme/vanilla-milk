This is a simple task manager. You can use it to:
- add tasks,
- finish tasks (and mark them as complete),
- edit tasks and
- delete tasks.

All that is implemented in vanilla JS (hence the name) and plain HTML and CSS. 
It is a little side project to review and practice DOM manipulation, data handling and storage in localStorage and media queries after working with React.js and UI frameworks like Bootstrap and Material-UI.

Since Vanilla Milk utilizes the browser's localStorage, you can use it without sending any of your tasks to a database you might not trust (your data stays in your browser and persist between browser sessions). 
But localStorage isn't the safest option anyway, so don't put anything super important or secret in there. ;)

A few useful features:
- navigate and enter tasks using your keyboard: use tab to switch between inputs and buttons and hit enter to add a new task after writing something into the input field)
- leave the site at any point without loosing your tasks (the only content that will not get saved is the content of the input field before you add it to the task list)

If you really need another task manager:
